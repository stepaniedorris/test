We urge you to share this letter with your clients and their insurer, Beazley. We apologize if our letter emphasizes points of fact and law that are already well known to you.

As you will have judged from the Complaint Don Vonk filed in San Francisco Superior Court Civil Action No. CGC-24-619682, he suffered serious bodily injury in the subject allision when he was swept overboard, after being struck by pieces of the <i>Naiad’s </i>starboard, main-deck handrail, and is charging Releasees with both negligence and gross negligence under general maritime law. In addition to Don Vonk, Releasees took twenty-six other Releasors aboard the <i>Naiad </i>on November 25, 2023, to witness the scattering of Mr. Vonk’s late father Abraham’s ashes at Kirby Cove<i>. </i>The <i>Naiad’s </i>master placed all the Releasors in “the zone of danger” when he allided with the sea wall while returning to that vessel’s berth in the West Basin. While no one other than Mr. Vonk suffered physical injuries as a result of that allision, maritime law gives any Releasor who experienced that accident from within the zone of danger a cause of action for the culpable infliction of emotional distress. See e.g. <i>Stacy v. Danielsen</i>, 609 F.3d 1033, 1043 (9th Cir. 2010). No one other than Don Vonk has thus far filed a lawsuit in connection with the subject allision, but the statute of limitations on such claims will not expire until November 25, 2026. 46</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">U.S.C. § 30106.  We are therefore making this Policy-Limits Demand on behalf of <i><b>all </b></i>the passengers aboard <i>Naiad </i>that day.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">As we will explain in the following, Don Vonk’s claim could easily produce a verdict in excess of one-million dollars all by itself. Since the instant Policy-Limits Demand offers to resolve not only Don Vonk’s claim but <i><b>all </b></i>the potential passenger claims arising out of the subject allision, the Beazley Insurance Co. (“Beazley”) is under a fiduciary obligation to accept it.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">BEAZLEY’S FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As you know:</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="p">There is an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract [including insurance policies] that neither party will do anything which will injure the right of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement.’ Therefore, </span>‘<i>an insurer . . . who refuses to accept a reasonable settlement within the policy limits in violation of its duty to consider in good faith the interest of the insured in the settlement, is liable for the entire judgment against the insured even if it exceeds the policy limits</i>.’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Gruenberg v.

The plaintiff must prove essentially the same elements as a land-based negligence claim at common law: that the defendant breached a legal duty, causing the injury sustained by the plaintiff.

[In re] Am. Milling, 409 F.3d [1005] 1018 [8th Cir. 2005]. As such, the plaintiff in an allision case may invoke the Oregon rule, which creates a rebuttable presumption that a moving vessel breached its duty of care when it allides with a stationary object.

In <i>Ehart, </i>the Ninth Circuit held that the statutory bar in § 27 of the Limitation of Liability Act (“LOLA”) prohibiting “‘a vessel transporting passengers between ports in the United States” from foisting a contractual provision on those passengers “limiting the liability of the owner, master, or agent for personal injury or death caused by the negligence or fault of the owner or the owner&#39;s employees or agents,’” does not apply to vessels “transporting passengers away from and back to a single port.” 92 F.4th at 851 (quoting 46 U.S.C. 90527(a)(1)). Because the <i>Naiad </i>typically transports mourners away from and back to Pier 39, Releasors have persuaded themselves that the liability release they obtained from on <i>Naiad’s </i>passengers was valid. But Releasors are wrong for <i><b>three </b></i>reasons.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;"><i><b>First</b></i>, on December 23, 2022, almost a full year before the subject allision, Congress amended 46 U.S.C. § 30502(b) in the wake of the <i>Conception </i>tragedy, see P.L. 117-263, Div K, Title CXV, Subtitle A, § 11503(c), 136 Stat. 4130, and removed T-boats like <i>Conception </i>and <i>Naiad </i>from the reach of LOLA and § 90527(a)(1). As a consequence, the Ninth Circuit’s holding in <i>Ehart </i>has no application here. Neither does § 90527(a)(1). Once Congress pulled T-boats like <i>Naiad </i>out.of LOLA and § 90527, those vessels fell back under the traditional, common-law rule. It has been settled for more than a century under that rule that “common carriers” may not impose exculpatory agreements on their passengers. See e.g. <i>Liverpool &amp; Great Western Steam Co. v. Phenix Ins. Co</i>., 129 U.S. 397, 439-440 (1889) (“<i>Liverpool Steam</i>”) (“By the common law of England and America before the Declaration of Independence, recognized by the weight of English authority for a half century afterwards, and upheld by decisions of the highest courts of many States of the Union, common carriers could not stipulate for immunity for their own or their servants’ negligence.”); <i>The Kensington</i>, 183 U.S. 263, 268 (1902) (“It is settled in the courts of the United States that exemptions limiting carriers from responsibility for the negligence of themselves or their servants are both unjust and unreasonable, and will be deemed wanting in the</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">element of voluntary assent; and, besides, that such conditions are in conflict with public policy. This doctrine was announced so long ago, and has been so frequently reiterated, that it is elementary.”); <i>The Oregon</i>, 133 F. 609, 630 (9th Cir. 1904) (“With respect to the other provision of the contract, relieving the carrier from responsibility of the carrier provided he has used due diligence to make the vessel seaworthy, it is perhaps sufficient to say that this provision, if it means anything, is also inapplicable to this case. But if, by any construction of its terms, it can be held applicable, it is clearly void by reason of being against public policy.”) (citing <i>Liverpool Steam, supra</i>). Those lodestar precedents remain as strong as ever today. See e.g. <i>Great Lakes Ins. SE v. Raiders Retreat Realty Co., LLC</i>, 601 U.S. 65, 76 (2024) (“For example, <i>The Kensington </i>declined to enforce a choice-of-law clause because the chosen law would have released a carrier from liability for negligence—<i><b>a result that maritime law forbids</b></i>.”) (emphasis added) (discussing “established” maritime rules).</p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Naiad <span class="p">is clearly a “common carrier” within the meaning of that rule</span>. <span class="p">As the Supreme Court explained with respect to a vessel that towed logs on Puget Sound, “[any]one who undertakes for hire to transport from place to place the property of others who may choose to employ him is a common carrier.”  </span>Washington ex rel.

In that case, the release stated, ‘This release and indemnity agreement shall apply to claims based upon negligence and for any other theory of recovery.’ <i>Id</i>. at 234. The court found that under Oregon law, a release for liability for more than ordinary negligence violates public policy. <i>Id. </i>at 235. The court concluded that the entire release was invalid because the language of the release did not manifest an intention by the parties to sever the contract. <i>Id</i>. at 236. The court observed, ‘In one simple, broad sentence, the defendant sought to exculpate itself for any and all claims.  It is not our role to enforce only part of the release clause where it is not obvious from the language of the clause that the parties intended the clause to be severable.’  <i>Id.</i>; but see <i>Wheelcock</i>, 839 F.

But Don’s injuries are not confined to his right leg. Although his left leg was not injured during the subject allision, it subsequently sustained permanent damage. When Plaintiff’s treaters closed the open right leg wounds with a skin graft on December 12, 2023, they harvested the skin from his left thigh. See Figure 11 above. That harvest left Mr. Vonk with a large patch of permanent scarring. Going forward, Don Vonk will need at least <b>$50,000 </b>of plastic surgery and would-care therapy to address those problems.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Quite apart from his medical expenses, Don Vonk will also suffer at least <b>$125,000 </b>in lifetime earnings losses. Don is a Certified Public Accountant and a Partner Emeritus at Considine &amp; Considine. He has been employed by that firm since 1984 and has typically enjoyed more than $220,000 in annual earnings. Considine &amp; Considine is a full-service accounting firm. Don monitors his clients’ finances year-round, forecasts and categorizes their revenues, plans their tax strategies, and prepares their returns. That work is <i>taxing </i>in every sense of the word; a small error in professional judgement can create large legal problems for his</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">clients. Don’s painful injuries and arduous recovery not only cost him countless work hours, they also dimmed his concentration, drained his stamina, reduced his work hours, and blighted his client list. As the United States Supreme Court has ruled with respect to maritime tort damages:</p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At one time it was thought appropriate to distinguish between compensating a plaintiff &quot;for the loss of time from his work which has actually occurred up to the time of trial&quot; and compensating him &quot;for the time which he will lose in [the] future.&quot; C. McCormick, Damages § 86 (1935). This suggested that estimated future earning capacity should be discounted to the date of trial, and a separate calculation should be performed for the estimated loss of earnings between injury and trial. Id., §§ 86, 87. It is both easier and more precise to discount the entire lost stream of earnings back to the date of injury -- the moment from which earning capacity was impaired. The plaintiff may then be awarded interest on that discounted sum for the period between injury and judgment, in order to ensure that the award when invested will still be able to replicate the lost stream. <i>See In re Air Crash Disaster Near Chicago, Illinois</i>, on May 25, 1979, 644 F.2d 633, 641-646 (CA7 1981); 1 Speiser § 8:6, p. 723.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp. v.

Don’s description of the <i>Naiad’s </i>starboard handrail’s knocking him over the stern after reshaping itself into animated, “Transformer-like” mass and hurtling towards him is hair-raising enough; but when one watches the video of the <i>Naiad’s </i>blindly backing down stern-first to retrieve him, it’s easy to understand Mr. Vonk’s ensuing fear that he was about to be sucked into her churning propellors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="317" height="422" alt="image" src="Vonk%20-%20Final%20Policy%20Limits%20Demand%20-%20Copy%2C%20NO%20VIDEO_files/Image_016.jpg"/></span>	<span><img width="320" height="426" alt="image" src="Vonk%20-%20Final%20Policy%20Limits%20Demand%20-%20Copy%2C%20NO%20VIDEO_files/Image_017.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 13 and 14: Mr. Vonk on a Gurney Leaving Pier 39 and Mr. Vonk after being extracted from the water</h2><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">After being pulled writhing and bleeding from the water in front of his family and friends, Don was attended to by the crew while the <i>Naiad </i>made her way back to her berth.

The required emergency care is often exploratory, painful, and bloody. There is no reason to ask a patient to endure such trauma while he or she is still awake absent unusual circumstances. In addition to everything else, Don Vonk suffered such circumstances. San Francisco General is chronically overcrowded, and when Don arrived there was no anesthesiologist at hand. Given the finding of Leukocytosis, the E.R. team had to act quickly.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Instead of waiting for someone who could administer a general anesthetic, the team gave Don a dose of Ketamine and treated his wounds while he was still awake. See Page 1 of 11.27.23 Medical Report of San Francisco General Hospital.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 41pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">According to the D.E.A., Ketamine is a “dissociative anesthetic” that has “hallucinogenic effects” such as “distort(ed) perceptions of sight and sound” that “make the user feel disconnected and not in control.”<span class="s3">9</span> It is considered a Schedule III substance, made the national news after it was found in the late Matthew Perry’s bloodstream, and remains highly controversial. Should this case go to trial, Don Vonk will explain that when his medical team discussed the possibility of using Ketamine, his nurse questioned that decision and warned Mr. Vonk to expect a “nightmare.” He quickly discovered what she meant. Don did not disassociate. Instead, he remained wide awake and endured a distorted, hallucinogenic, out-of-body experience in which he “hovered” above the operating table and watched his surgeons: splay and pin back his already yawning laceration; hose out blood, viscera and debris from the wound; scrub the layer of subcutaneous fat that was now exposed; and mop up his puddled blood from the floor. As the Operative Report deadpanned: “ketamine was a very bad experience…” See <i>Id</i>. Don thought living “nightmare” was more accurate.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="192" height="1" alt="image" src="Vonk%20-%20Final%20Policy%20Limits%20Demand%20-%20Copy%2C%20NO%20VIDEO_files/Image_019.png"/></span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">9<span class="s7"> </span><i>See </i><a href="http://www.dea.gov/factsheets/ketamine" class="a" target="_blank">https://www.dea.gov/factsheets/ketamine</a><a href="http://www.dea.gov/factsheets/ketamine" class="s17" target="_blank">.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 144pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="326" height="385" alt="image" src="Vonk%20-%20Final%20Policy%20Limits%20Demand%20-%20Copy%2C%20NO%20VIDEO_files/Image_020.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 131pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: left;">Figure 15: Plaintiff’s 11.26.23 23 Operative Procedure Irrigation and Debridement and Application of Wound Vacuum</h2><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">The day after surviving the Ketamine, Don underwent an Irrigation and Debridement.<span class="s3">10</span> That surgery is shown in Figure 15 above. An Irrigation and Debridement is a surgical procedure in which necrotic and infected tissue are cut from an open laceration before the wound is irrigated and cleaned. Mr. Vonk’s surgery was complex and included: the “evacuat(ion)” of “a bunch of old blood clots;” the “sharp” debridement of more than 13 cm of skin, subcutaneous fat and bleeding tissue; and the application of a “wound vacuum” with a black sponge.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Mr. Vonk was discharged from SF General on November 29, 2023, and directed to begin immediate care at Sharp Memorial Hospital near his home in San Diego. His son rented a minivan, placed Don in the back, and drove him overnight to San Diego. Although Don’s right leg was wrapped in a post-surgical dressing, the laceration remained open during the drive.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Because his physicians at S.F.

To date, that course has included the surgical application of a Skin Graft, 5 weeks of wound-vacuum therapy, a second Irrigation-and-Debridement Operation, and months of physical therapy. Skin grafting is a procedure in which a surgeon harvests healthy skin from one area of a patient’s body and transplants it to a damaged area. The skin graft pictured in Figure 16 shows skin that was harvested from Mr. Vonk’s left leg and surgically implanted on his right thigh on December 20, 2023.</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">A wound vacuum is a medical device which applies negative pressure to an open wound and sucks fluid, plasma, pus, and bacteria from the cavity. It attaches directly to the body, has its own power source, and accompanies the patient wherever he or she goes. Figure 17 depicts the wound vacuum that remained attached to Don Vonk’s right leg for approximately five weeks. That photo does not depict the bag that was secured to Mr. Vonk’s body where the evacuated fluids and contaminants were stored. After Don was discharged from Sharp, his healthcare providers gave</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">him the noisome tasks of detaching the vacuum, changing the dressing, emptying the bag, and reattaching the vacuum. He suffered excruciating pain every single time he did so.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">As previously noted, an irrigation and debridement is an invasive surgical procedure. Figure 18 depicts the one Don endured on December 20, 2023.<span class="s3">11</span> That time, the operation included: the excision of 15 x 9 cm of necrotic skin, subcutaneous tissue and facia; the application of the skin graft depicted above; and the attachment of a new wound vacuum.<span class="s3">12</span> In addition to all that prescribed care, Don has taken his own steps to try and win back the strength of his withered right leg. He completed a 4-week course of physical therapy, hired a personal trainer, performed home exercises and stretching every day, and began Pilates on his own dime. While those services and expenses were all necessitated by the subject allision, none of them were included in the special damages we listed earlier.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="587" height="303" alt="image" src="Vonk%20-%20Final%20Policy%20Limits%20Demand%20-%20Copy%2C%20NO%20VIDEO_files/Image_025.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 190pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 19: Plaintiff’s Pre-Accident Activities</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="192" height="1" alt="image" src="Vonk%20-%20Final%20Policy%20Limits%20Demand%20-%20Copy%2C%20NO%20VIDEO_files/Image_026.png"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">11 <span class="p">See 12.21.23 Operative Report, previously produced in the course of written discovery as Exhibit 5, Bates Numbers 00466 – 00678.</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">12 <span class="s2">Id.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As should be easy for the reader to imagine, the divot in Don Vonk’s right thigh and the corresponding loss of muscle, nerves and tendons have permanently disfigured Don and left him with life-changing disabilities and limitations. Quite apart from the chronic pain, numbness, and weakness in his right leg, Don also experiences sympathetic aches, pain, tightness, and loss of mobility in his left leg due to overcompensation. Before his injuries, Mr. Vonk was physically active, adventurous, and so musically inclined that he was regularly paid to play on stage. He loved to ski, golf, hike, mountain bike, travel and play percussion. Don spent the great majority of his weekends outside, was hired by cover bands as a drummer, and enjoyed traveling abroad and experiencing life in full. The images in Figure 19 above capture just the tip of that iceberg and show him on stage in San Diego, skiing in Montana, hiking in Sedona, golfing in San Francisco, Zip-Lining in Costa Rica, mountain-biking in Arizona, taking a Safari in Kenya, and ‘surfing’ the sand dunes of Dubai. Don had doggedly returned to some of those hobbies but can no longer enjoy any of them in the same way. He has given up the drums entirely (the right leg controls the bass drum and must flex on almost every beat), is unable to bike down dirt trails, is incapable of walking longer than 5 miles or hiking any distance without ski poles, and experiences a host of symptoms every time he attempts to golf. But he has suffered other more subtle but equally painful losses.</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">When Don and his friends and family members boarded the <i>Naiad </i>to scatter Abraham Vonk’s ashes, they were embarking on the first part of a day-long memorial. Had the allision not put an end to their plan, the entire Vonk family would have continued on to Tommy Woks, in Sausalito, for a celebration of Abraham Vonk’s life. Don was close to his dad, but like many sons, he had never explicitly shared the extent of his feelings. Don had therefore spent hours writing a heart-felt eulogy for his father. That cathartic eulogy was freighted with all the thoughts and feelings that went unsaid between father and son and would have been delivered to a room full of appreciative family members. Plaintiff never got to share those feelings or deliver that tribute and, instead, spent the afternoon of November 25, 2023, undergoing emergency surgery under the influence of Ketamine.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Two-and-a-half months later, Don would have to miss the wedding of his best friend, John Bokosky. Don and Jon are more like brothers than friends. They met in 1995, have grown</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">ever closer since then, and have shared almost every major event of their adult lives. Before Capt. Everitt “clipped” the sea wall on November 25, 2023, John had not only asked Don to be the Best Man at John’s February 2, 2024, wedding in St. Kitts, he also asked Don to preside over the event as the master of ceremonies. After accepting that honor, Don spent weeks planning the nuptials. He immersed himself in the couple’s wishes and helped put together a ceremony that he hoped John and his fiancée would never forget. The wedding went forward as planned, but Don was still recovering and unable to attend it.</p></li></ol></li><li data-list-text="II."><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 86pt;text-indent: -35pt;text-align: left;">The Other Releasors’ Harms and Losses</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Under the well-settled maritime rule:</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">[A] bystander who is in a zone of physical danger and who, because of the defendant’s negligence, has reasonable fear for his own safety is given a right of action for physical injury or illness resulting from emotional distress.

All twenty-six of the other Releasors shared the zone of physical danger with Don Vonk aboard the <i>Naiad </i>when Capt.

Imagine a Beazley claims manager meets them at the Gate and, instead of handing them an unenforceable release, asks them whether they would jointly accept a check for $1,000,000. They naturally ask: “What do we have to do for it?” The claims manager answers:</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">You’ll have to forego your plans to eulogize and celebrate the life of Abraham Vonk and let our captain, Brian Everitt, take you out onto the Bay aboard the <span class="p">Naiad </span>whence you will watch helplessly as he careens into the Pier 39 sea wall at a speed of seven or eight knots on the way home. Don, you and your brother will have to place yourselves on the <span class="p">Naiad’s </span>starboard quarter during that crash and watch from there as the vessel’s starboard handrail transforms itself into a mass of twisted metal that hurtles aft and knocks Don head-over-heels into the water. All of you will have to nervously witness Don struggle to stay afloat in the <span class="p">Naiad’s </span>wake while Capt. Everitt urgently backs that vessel towards him with both propellers churning astern.  Don, after that hurtling mass of wreckage has gouged a “life/limb- threating” divot out of your right thigh, you will have to immerse yourself and your wound in the teeming and biting salt water of Pier 39’s West Basin, while Capt. Everitt backs blindly towards you. Although you will be pulled aboard the <span class="p">Naiad </span>and spared from any further, in-water injuries, a literal nightmare will await you ashore. After the paramedics take you off the vessel on a gurney in front of your shocked family and friends, you will be spirited to San Francisco General Hospital and given a hallucinogen while doctors and nurses attend to your gaping and badly-infected wound as you look on in pain and confusion in the throes of a horrifying out-of-body experience. After several pain-filled days as an in-patient at S.F. General – days that will be punctuated with surgical skin grafts and debridements -- your son will drive you for eight extremely uncomfortable hours in a rented van to Sharp Memorial Hospital down in San Diego, where you will suffer another wound revision and more debridements. You will be discharged with a wound vacuum and left to change your own dressings and empty your own vacuum bag for five long weeks. The disfiguring divot in your right thigh will never fully heal, you will never play music or ride a dirt trail again and your life will never be the same.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">We all know how Don and his family would have responded to Beazley’s offer.
